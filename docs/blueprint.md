# **App Name**: Fiscal Flow Animated

## Core Features:

- Dashboard Replication: Replicate the main dashboard's layout and data display (KPIs, alerts, graphs, lists) with mock data, matching the reference site.
- Frauds Analysis Page Replication: Reproduce the fraud analysis page including the layout of summary KPIs and fraud cases using mock data.
- Data Crossing Page Replication: Mimic the data crossing page featuring a grid of data source cards (e.g., 'Receita Federal', 'DETRAN') with a functional click effect.
- Network Analysis Page Replication: Replicate the network analysis page layout including a list of monitored individuals and a visualization area for financial network analysis (mock visualization).
- Georeferencing Analysis Replication: Implement the georeferencing analysis page with tabs for 'Image Analysis', 'Detected Results', and 'Monitoring', featuring upload cards and base/current image views with KPIs.
- 24/7 Virtual Assistant Chat UI: Create a chat interface that replicates the 24/7 virtual assistant including canned welcome messages and 'Quick Actions' with supporting protocols and statistics.
- AI-Powered Anomaly Alerting Tool (Simulated): Simulate the anomaly detection features to present potentially unusual incidents through integration of generative AI models. The alert may incorporate information such as unusual accounting information found across financial reports.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #58B8E1 (RGB) for a fresh and professional look, inspired by the original reference site's use of blue tones.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB), a very light tint of blue for a clean, calm backdrop.
- Accent color: #FFA07A (RGB), a light orange for call-to-action buttons and to highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, giving a precise, contemporary feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, for readability in longer sections. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use consistent, simple, and modern icons throughout the application. These icons will match those in the reference application. Aim for a professional, unified visual language.
- Follow the reference website to keep a similar dashboard layout using a sidebar for navigation. Responsive design considerations, for desktop screens, should replicate the look and placement exactly.
- Implement subtle, smooth transitions for page navigation and interactive elements. Replicate animation style exactly from the reference website.
